Automatic Cash Depositing Mashine
---------------------------------
I would like to recreate an ATM based on depositing cash and send the data data received to the server, I was thinking on using the requirements below
1. User Interface (Touch Screen)
2. 3 Way Bill Counter(One side Inserting Cash, Another side Taking Valid bills to the safe and last side returning counterfeits back when inserted to the counter)
3. P.O.S (For gennerating receipt when transaction was sucessfully)
4. Safe (For storing cash received)
5. UPS (Backup Power)
6. CPU (Containing software and Motherboard linking all devices together so that they can work at appropriate time required)
7. Router (Simple Networking device so that i can update the system any time and sending data to server so it cant be lost)
I develop softwares in Python, PHP and React. Im not too expert at C, but i think is the reliable language to use when linking devices together.
Im open for suggestions and contributions that can help developing this project
Thanks a lot
